# Pathfinding_visualiser-WEC

## Setting Up
- Clone the repo
- `cd` into `a_star_visualizer\yuvraj-wale\`
- Start a static python server using `python -m http.server`

Open the served page on a browser and enjoy. Default - `localhost:8000`

## List of implemented features :
- implemented `A star` pathfinding algorithm which finds the shortest path between 2 points in the fastest way possible as compared to other pathfinding algorithms.
- used `p5.js` to simulate the algorithm on a canvas
- finally added the `frontend` UI elements such as a header and a footer.

## List of non-implemented/planned features :
- to add other pathfinding algorithms like dijkstras, BFS, DFS...etc as an option to choose from for the user .
- an option to add specefic obstacles for the user and not limiting to only randomly generated obstacles.
- to make the website responsive for all devices.

## List of known bugs :
- the grid turns white for a split second in between while the algorithm is working.
